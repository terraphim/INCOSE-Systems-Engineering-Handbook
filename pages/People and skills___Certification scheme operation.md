sfiaguidancenotes:: The overall purpose of certification of persons is to recognise an individual's competence to  perform a task or job or determine whether they have met some knowledge criteria. Knowledge and competence are different and the two terms should not be confused. A certification body has the responsibility to ensure that only people who demonstrate competence are awarded competence certification. Certification of people provides value through public confidence and trust. Public confidence relies on a valid assessment of competence by a third party, reconfirmed at defined intervals. The certification body should act responsibly to provide confidence to interested parties in its competence, impartiality and integrity. Activities may include — but are not limited to: verifying on request whether an individual holds a currently valid certificate and the scope of that certification, except where the law prevents the information from being disclosed
documenting security policies and procedures, including non-disclosure or other agreements not to release confidential examination materials or participate in fraudulent practices
implementing arrangements for certified persons to inform the certification body of anything affecting capability to continue meeting certification requirements.
