sfiaguidancenotes:: Service acceptance criteria are used to ensure that a service meets the defined service requirements, including functionality, operational support, performance, safety, security and quality requirements. Acceptance criteria include both utility/functional and  warranty/non-functional tests. Activities may include — but are not limited to: engaging with a variety of stakeholders and delivery life-cycle activities such as — but not limited to — external service providers, technical design, software development and project management, implementing service acceptance practices to support iterative/agile working, ensuring the service provider is ready to operate the new service when it has been deployed.
