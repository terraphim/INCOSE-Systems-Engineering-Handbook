- ### About me
  collapsed:: true
	- #jobseeking
	- Both my parents were software developers, so my strive for the technology was pretty determined from my early days. Since age 14 I've been working at family company that built computers and software, and I got some practical business knowledge from that time. Then I graduated automatic control department at university, where my specialization was digital signal processing and industrial automation.
	- In 2002 together with a partner we launched game development company which was hot that days and build prototype for an RPG game, that got press coverage and venture investments, but we didn't proceed with the launch, though got a lot of experience hiring programmers, artists, building the product, and communicating with publishers and the investor on the progress and lack of it. It was interesting experience and a lot of lessons learned from it I applied later on. One thing I realized is that engineering and design processes needed to be managed and even produced, like in movies. So I went for that back to my engineering career.
	- For five years after university I've been working as an electronics and hardware design engineer and later for another five years as a product engineer. This 10 year of engineering experience has taught me well about data-driven decision making and cost-driven development process, where you always think about the product price, the margin and the profits you make. I also became very accurate and disciplined, and improved my team-working skills benefiting from the strong corporate culture of international projects at R&D centers of Elcoteq, Nokia company and General Motors ITDC at Russelsheim.
	- During my engineering career I felt that we're not always building the right things for the customer and the market, so I decided to go for engineering management to fix the processes. I didn't know much about Agile and product management back then in 2011 and it was a tough journey learning proper organization of R&D the hard way. But all mistakes considering I did pretty well and my team delivered two product lines for LED smart lighting systems for offices and for agriculture. One of the products has been awarded with industry prize, got press coverage, and finally resulted in successful business that has been sold to Osram.
	- This first product management experience taught me to validate everything engineers are building and be not only cost-aware of decisions implications, but always check the product-market fit. It was also wake-up call for me to manage R&D processes very carefully, communicate with engineers, sales and marketing a lot in a structured way, and reduce delivery cycles as much as possible. That became my guiding principles for years ahead.
	- And a final mindset change for me started when I moved to retail. It's not only technology-intensive business with a lot of dependencies, it's also very fast-moving business with a short feedback cycles and huge cost of mistakes because the scale of operations. And all that demands evidence-based decision-making and heavy customer orientation, especially when you're introducing eCommerce solution, which in 2014 was in its early days and nobody knew very much about it. Again, many mistakes have been made, we've learned Agile ways of working painfully but incremental development found its path to the money and in the end we did fine, closing the M&A deal with Leroy Merlin.
	- In 2017 was my first encounter with product management and systems engineering on the project where we launched new convenience store concept and JosDeVries was our product designer. That was a time when I found out about A/B testing, hypothesis validation and business prototyping techniques. Maybe it was the most rewarding experience in my career as we were launching big product in big corporation. After we completed the project and I got my exit bonus, I established my own consultancy, using all the experience and connections I got from previous jobs. That was my second business attempt and it was more successful than the first, I was operating for four years until the war.
	- I believe, I have all the knowledge and skills to become a good product manager in your company:
		- I love making business and deliver useful products for the customers in a compliant and viable manner;
		- I know how engineers build things and how to communicate with them efficiently to find the most feasible way to implement and integrate the product;
		- and, finally, I can think clearly with numbers and build conceptual understanding of the market and the business, and not just drown decision-making with irrelevant data and so-called 'evidence'.
	- I also worked in different industries and with a lot of people, so I have wide perspective for both opportunities and risks assessment. So, that's me and let's discuss your needs for this position further.
- ### Test results of Understand myself Bif 5 traits (Jordan Peterson)
  collapsed:: true

	- **Agreeableness: Typical**
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FOWfVudWrLT.png?alt=media&token=726d3826-bba5-436f-8650-c4c75bd7bcd2)
		- You are typical or average in agreeableness, which is the primary dimension of Interpersonal interaction in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness, which will be explained separately. Agreeableness is a very complex trait, with marked positive and negative elements all along its distribution. Because of this, higher scores and lower scores need to be explained at the same time.
		- People high in agreeableness are nice: compliant, nurturing, kind, naively trusting and conciliatory. However, because of their tendency to avoid conflict, they often dissemble and hide what they think. People low in agreeableness are not so nice: stubborn, dominant, harsh, skeptical, competitive and, in the extreme, even predatory. However, they tend to be straightforward, even blunt, so you know where they stand.
		- Your score puts you at the 50th percentile for agreeableness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more agreeable than 50 of them and less agreeable than 49 of them.
		- People with typical levels of agreeableness are seen by others as somewhat cooperative, warm and considerate. They look for and even sometimes see the best in others, and are reasonably interpersonally tolerant (an attitude that is much valued by agreeable people). They are no more sensitive than average to seeing someone’s feelings get hurt and, although sometimes concerned about the emotional state of others, don’t always prefer peace and harmony to conflict. They strike a good balance between submissiveness and dominance.
		- People with average levels of agreeableness are somewhat forgiving, accepting, flexible, gentle and patient. They sometimes feel pity for those who are excluded, punished or defeated. However, they are less likely than highly agreeable people to be taken advantage of by disagreeable people or those with criminal or predatory intent. They can be skeptical. They believe in cooperation, but also feel that competition, with its losers and winners, has its valid place. They are less likely to lose arguments (and will not typically avoid discussion) with less agreeable people. They can be quite good at bargaining for themselves, and at negotiating for more recognition or power. They are likely to have somewhat higher salaries and earn more money, in consequence. This may mean they are less likely to suffer from resentment or to harbour invisible anger, although this tendency may be increased, if they are high in neuroticism. In addition, because of their tendency to engage in conflict, when necessary, typically agreeable people are less prone to sacrifice medium- to long-term stability and function for the sake of short-term peace. This can mean that problems that should be solved in the present are often solved, and do not accumulate counterproductively across time.
		- Women are higher in agreeableness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 61.5. For men it is 38.5. The fact that men are lower in agreeableness than women helps explain their much higher rates of criminal incarceration (90% male). The primary difference between criminals and non-criminals is disagreeableness. If the typical criminal is more disagreeable than 98% of people in the general population, then almost all those criminals will be male. This difference in agreeableness between men and women is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.
		- Agreeableness, per se, is not strongly associated with political liberalism or conservatism, but this is because the aspects of agreeableness predict such political belief in opposite ways, and cancel each other out. Liberals are higher in aspect compassion, and conservatives in aspect politeness. However, alliance with the category of belief that has come to be known as politically correct is strongly predicted by agreeableness (particularly compassion). What this appears to mean is that agreeable people strongly identify with those they deem oppressed, seeing them, essentially, as exploited infants, and demonize those they see as oppressors, seeing them as cruel, heartless predators.
		- There are large differences between men and women in terms of spontaneous interest, and these also appear associated with agreeableness. Agreeable people, caring as they do for others, are more likely to enter professions associated with people, such as teaching and nursing, which are dominated by women. This is true even in the Scandinavian countries, where attempts to produce gender-equal societies has reached a maximum. Disagreeable people, by contrast, appear to prefer systematizing over empathizing, and are more interested in things – machines and technology. In consequence, professions such as engineering and trades associated with construction and machinery tend to be dominated by relatively disagreeable men.
		- Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness.
		- **Compassion: Moderately High**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2Foy3sXPH8fr.png?alt=media&token=31a80e64-49b8-41ce-8f92-5359ed6ca875)
			- You are moderately high in compassion, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the **66th** percentile for compassion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more compassionate than **66** of them and less compassionate than **33** of them.
			- Moderately compassionate people are interested in the problems of other people, and other living things. They are concerned about helping other people avoid negative emotion. They make time and do kind things for others, even when doing so may interfere with fulfilling their own needs and interests. They have a noticeably soft side. Other people consider them sympathetic and nice, and will turn to them often for a listening ear. They are empathetic and caring. However, because they are so other-oriented, they may find it difficult to negotiate on their own behalf, and may not get what they deserve (for their hard work, for example). This may lead to feelings of resentment.
			- Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat higher in compassion than conservatives.
			- Women are also higher in compassion than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 61. For men it is 39.
		- **Politeness: Moderately Low**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FJVEXwtxDOl.png?alt=media&token=5fca4f43-1076-425d-96f3-4e313792ce5d)
			- You are moderately low in politeness, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the **32nd** percentile for politeness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less polite than **67** of them and more polite than **32** of them.
			- People who are moderately low in politeness are not particularly deferential to authority – nor are they markedly obedient. They can be respectful, but only to people who clearly deserve it, and they are willing to push back when challenged. They are not particularly uncomfortable confronting other people. People moderately low in politeness are not particularly motivated to avoid conflict, or to steer clear of conflict or fights.
			- Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat lower in politeness than conservatives (the opposite pattern is seen with compassion).
			- Women are higher in politeness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 59. For men it is 41.
	- **Conscientiousness: Moderately Low**
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FlkjXQ2N12L.png?alt=media&token=3f0ccd34-9907-4b4d-8a6c-70a176125f1e)
		- You are moderately low in conscientiousness, which is the primary dimension of dutiful achievement in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Conscientiousness is a measure of obligation, attention to detail, hard work, persistence, cleanliness, efficiency and adherence to rules, standards and processes. Conscientious people implement their plans and establish and maintain order.
		- Your score puts you at the **38th** percentile for conscientiousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less conscientious than **61** of them and more conscientious than **38** of them.
		- People moderately low in conscientiousness are not particularly dutiful. They are by no means sloggers. They will only work hard if pushed, and don’t mind wasting time. They are quite likely to procrastinate (particularly if they are also above average in neuroticism). If people with moderately low levels of conscientiousness commit to doing something, there is a good chance they will be late, or delayed, even if there isn’t much reason for it. They tend to find and deliver excuses for their failure under such circumstances. They are not markedly decisive, neat, organized, future-oriented, or reliable, and they find themselves easily distracted.
		- People with moderately low levels of conscientiousness are less likely to obtain higher grades in academic settings (particularly if they are also less intelligent), and generally require substantial supervision to stay on task. For this reason, they make less than optimal managers and administrators. They do not feel compelled to do things by the book, however. This can perhaps be an advantage if they are engaged in creative tasks, where rules must be broken for advancement to take place. They are unlikely to make career accomplishment a primary goal, turning instead to pursuit of safety and security (if high in neuroticism), creative accomplishment (if high in openness), establishment of intimate relationships and friendships (if highly agreeable), or social success, excitement and fun (if extraverted).
		- People moderately low in conscientiousness tend to be relatively free of guilt, shame, self-disgust and self-contempt. Other people, however, may react negatively to their tendency to slack off (particularly if those other people are disagreeable and conscientious).
		- Individuals who are moderately low in conscientious are not particularly concerned by failure. They are not judgmental, to themselves or others, and tend towards situational explanations for disappointment, frustration or lack of success. They can handle periods of inactivity and unemployment with relative ease. They tend to downplay the relationship between hard work, diligence and success, believing that chance factors and luck in life play a determining role. They live, in large part, for leisure and very much look forward to time off. They can be good at relaxing, and living in the moment (particularly when low in neuroticism). They are less concerned than average with cleaning, moral purity and achievement. It’s more fun to be at the beach or at a party with a person moderately low in conscientiousness – but you might not want to invite them over on moving day.
		- People moderately low in conscientiousness are more likely to be political liberals rather than conservatives. This is particularly true if they are also high in openness.
		- Women are very slightly more conscientious than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For men it is 49.5.
		- Conscientiousness has two aspects: industriousness and orderliness.
		- **Industriousness: Moderately Low**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FfDTzQam7fE.png?alt=media&token=d6adb00e-4cbd-4878-978c-3fe63f1338b5)
			- You are moderately low in industriousness, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at the **38th** percentile for industriousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less industrious than **61** of them and more industrious than **38** of them.
			- People who are lower in industriousness are less likely to be successful in school and in administrative and managerial positions (particularly if they are also less intelligent). If they are highly intelligent, they are likely to be regarded as underachievers. They don’t focus on work as much as others and are more likely to procrastinate, miss deadlines, or fail to complete assignments or projects completely. They have a tendency to put off responsibilities, concentrating more on fun, worry, relationships, excitement or creative endeavour. They aren’t particularly concerned with schedules, timelines or efficiency, and may have to be supervised excessively before their tasks will be completed. They lack focus and are easily distracted.
			- People moderately low in industriousness are not judgmental to themselves or others. They tend to let people, including themselves, off the hook. They are less likely to believe that people fail because they don’t apply themselves or work hard, assuming that chance and luck play the determining roles. They are not prone to guilt, self-disgust or self-contempt, and have a laissez-faire, whatever-will-be-will-be attitude toward life.
			- Those who are liberal and those who are conservatives appear equally industrious.
			- Men are slightly more industrious than women. The mean percentile for men in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For women it is 49.5.
		- **Orderliness: Typical or Average**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FrYzHWz6rd9.png?alt=media&token=243939a7-6ee7-4984-b7b3-3faf737cd1b8)
			- You are average or typical in orderliness, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at the **41st** percentile for orderliness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more orderly than **41** of them and less orderly than **58** of them.
			- Typically orderly people are neither particularly disturbed nor disgusted by mess and chaos. They keep everything moderately tidy and organized. They don’t think in terms of simple black and white; in their world, there are many shades of grey. They don’t rely overmuch on schedules, lists or routines, preferring to take things as they come. They are not overly oriented toward detail, rigidly rule-abiding or judgemental.
			- They like routine and predictability, under some circumstances, but don’t mind if such things are disrupted. They can manage complex, sensitive processes when supervised properly and carefully, but may have to be reminded to pay proper attention and maintain focus. They can, however, tolerate the mess, disruption and intervening periods of chaos that may accompany creative endeavor.
			- Those who are average in orderliness are no more likely to be political conservatives or liberals, although they will tend toward the former, if low in openness to experience and the latter if high.
			- Women are more orderly than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 54.5. For men it is 45.5. This may account for some of the trouble in relation to housework between women and men. Since women are, on average, more orderly, household disorder will trigger disgust and discomfort in them faster. This may happen with sufficient frequency so they end up doing a disproportionate share of such work (even though if they waited a bit longer their less orderly partners, often men, might end up equally troubled and motivated to fix the problem). Orderly people are more likely to have items such as event calendars, drawer organizers, laundry baskets, irons and ironing boards in their immediate environments.
	- **Extraversion: Moderately Low**
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FV342RVvM8e.png?alt=media&token=0ecb2be7-db81-4089-9009-1272bc09c24e)
		- You are moderately low in extraversion, which is the primary dimension of positive emotion in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. You could also think of yourself as moderately high in introversion. Extraversion is a measure of general sensitivity to positive emotions such as hope, joy, anticipation and approach, particularly in social situations.
		- Your score puts you at the **25th** percentile for extraversion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less extraverted than **74** of them and more extraverted than **25** of them.
		- People with moderately low levels of extraversion are not particularly enthusiastic, talkative, assertive in social situations, or gregarious. They tend to find excessive social contact draining and tiring, and crave time alone to recharge. They are less likely to plan parties, tell jokes, make people laugh, or volunteer for community activities. They are somewhat more likely to be depressed and to have lower levels of self-esteem (particularly if they are high in neuroticism). They are less optimistic about the past, present and future.
		- People who are moderately low in extraversion find it relatively easy to keep things to themselves. They are not compelled to share everything with everyone. They are not particularly self-disclosing and do not warm up quickly to other people. They are more comfortable with one-to-one interactions than in a group-oriented situation. They are rarely the first to speak in meetings, although they will express an opinion if asked. They are less likely to captivate and convince, and will rarely be the first to act in an ambiguous situation.
		- People who are moderately low in extraversion are better suited to occupations that require work alone or with a few other well-known individuals (such as computer programming or accounting). Jobs involving sales, persuasion, work in groups and public speaking are unlikely to appeal to them, and they are less likely to be successful at such things (particularly if they are also high in neuroticism).
		- People moderately low in extraversion are relatively unlikely to be impulsive, even when offered the opportunity to do something exciting or fun. They are therefore less likely to sacrifice the future to the present, when something social or group-oriented beckons. They find it relatively easy to be alone to study and work. They are not easily distracted by opportunities to chat, joke and socialize. This is particularly the case if they are also high in conscientiousness. However, when people are introverted and conscientious, they are less productive than when extraverted and conscientiousness, perhaps because they have lower levels of energy. When introverted and comparatively unconscientiousness, however, they are more productive than when extraverted and unconscientious.
		- People moderately low in extraversion tend to be less dominant in social situations, particularly if they are also low in agreeableness. Less agreeable extraverts tend to be self-centered – something that can be made worse if they are also low in conscientiousness. More introverted people are somewhat protected against such tendencies.
		- Those who are politically liberal are slightly less extraverted than conservatives.
		- Women are slightly more extraverted than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 52. For men it is 48.
		- Extraversion has two aspects: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness.
		- **Enthusiasm: Low**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FICS8fxEu7j.png?alt=media&token=3a5e59b9-f5f7-4493-bdee-9a9307ede3f5)
			- You are low in enthusiasm, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the **21st** percentile for enthusiasm. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less enthusiastic than **78** of them and more enthusiastic than **21** of them.
			- Individuals who are low in enthusiasm are not excitable. They are also much less easy to get to know, as they are not chatty or bubbly. When they do talk, it tends to be about things in which they find particular interest. They open up to other people with some difficulty, particularly in larger social gatherings or parties. They laugh much more rarely than others. They prefer solitude and, although they can enjoy themselves around other people, it has to be in small doses. They are much more private people, and are not markedly positive or optimistic. They avoid the spotlight and, if creative, may find performing much less desirable and draining. They rarely seek out stimulation, excitement, activity or fun (and, if they do so, prefer quieter activities). People low in enthusiasm are not gregarious or people-loving, and find it more difficult to generate a felt sense of excitement when offered the opportunity to engage in something that others might find engaging or entertaining.
			- Enthusiasm is not strongly associated with political preference, either conservative or liberal.
			- Women are higher in enthusiasm than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 55. For men it is 45.
		- **Assertiveness: Moderately Low**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FlupTBJipSx.png?alt=media&token=6baf00a2-0385-4c3d-8706-b93b340e17d5)
			- You are moderately low in assertiveness, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the **36th** percentile for assertiveness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less assertive than **63** of them and more assertive than **36** of them.
			- Somewhat less assertive people are not known to be “take charge” types. They put their own opinions forward with reservation, and rarely attempt to dominate and control social situations. Somewhat less assertive people are generally not influential or captivating in social groups. They have less of the communication style that is often associated with leadership. This can be somewhat of a handicap when they are knowledgeable, competent and able, but causes less trouble when they aren’t. Those moderately low in assertiveness are less likely to be people of action. They rarely in heedlessly and, in consequence, tend to allow others to lead the way. They are not typically impulsive, in consequence, and rarely act without thinking.
			- Liberals tend to be slightly less assertive than conservatives.
			- Women are slightly less assertive than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 48. For men it is 52.
	- **Neuroticism: Typical or Average**
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FIIKpZmJa4o.png?alt=media&token=4c0e4a82-c868-42e8-9083-8447b9dfaf39)
		- You have typical levels of neuroticism, which is the primary dimension of negative emotion in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Neuroticism is a measure of general sensitivity to negative emotions such as pain, sadness, irritable or defensive anger, fear and anxiety.
		- Your score puts you at the **59th** percentile for neuroticism. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in neuroticism than **59** of them and lower in neuroticism than **40** of them.
		- People with typical or average levels of neuroticism have a balanced view of the happiness and sadness of the past, present and future. Sometimes they are unhappy, anxious and irritable, particularly when facing a genuine problem, but they generally cope well and don’t worry too much.
		- They have normal levels of self-esteem, particularly when they are also average or above average in extraversion. They are not particularly at risk for developing anxiety disorders and depression.
		- People with average or typical levels of neuroticism are able to experience the consequences of success and to be appropriately satisfied in relationships and career. Average levels of neuroticism are associated with no more than average concern about mental and physical health, a typical number of physician and emergency room visits, and an expected degree of absenteeism at work and at school (unless accompanied by very low levels of conscientiousness).
		- People with average levels of neuroticism appear to neither seek risk out, nor avoid it. They are interested in security, but can also handle recreational, career, financial and social situations where the possibility of loss is higher. Such people appear to be concerned both with maintaining their current status, as well as enhancing it. This is a reasonable strategy in genuinely dangerous or uncertain times and better times alike.
		- Neuroticism is not a powerful predictor of political belief, either conservative or liberal.
		- Females tend to be higher in neuroticism than males. The typical woman is higher in neuroticism than 60% of the general population of men and women combined. In part, this may be why women report more unhappiness in their relationships, at work, in school and with their health than men, on average, and why women initiate 70% of all divorces. This difference in neuroticism between men and women appears to emerge at puberty. It is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.
		- Trait neuroticism is made up of the aspects withdrawal and volatility.
		- **Withdrawal: Moderately High**
		  collapsed:: true
			- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2F6ORtFNsbcP.png?alt=media&token=b96390ae-86fd-4abb-8972-e17aff74cbb2)
			- You are moderately high in withdrawal, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your score puts you at the **62nd** percentile for withdrawal. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in withdrawal than **62** of them and lower in withdrawal than **37** of them.
			- Individuals moderately high in withdrawal may feel higher than average levels of anticipatory anxiety. This makes it more challenging for them to approach new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations. They are somewhat more likely to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected.
			- People moderately high in withdrawal are a bit more likely than average to feel sad, lonesome, disappointed and grief-stricken. They tend to somewhat higher levels of doubt and worry, become embarrassed a bit more easily, are self-conscious and may get discouraged more rapidly in the face of threat and punishment. They feel more anticipatory anxiety than the average person. They are somewhat sensitive to social rejection, and can feel more hurt than might be expected. Once hurt, frightened, or anxious, as well, it takes them somewhat longer to recover. Perhaps people moderately high in withdrawal are concerned that something bad might happen, while people moderately high in volatility (the other aspect of neuroticism) suffer more if something bad genuinely does happen. Technically, withdrawal has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate passive avoidance.
			- Those who are liberal, politically, are slightly higher in withdrawal than conservatives.
			- Women are higher in withdrawal than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 60. For men it is 40.

			- You are typical or average in volatility, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your puts you at the **53rd** percentile for volatility. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more volatile than **53** of them and less volatile than **46** of them.
			- Individuals average in volatility tend to not to vary abnormally in their mood. They are not particularly irritable, and feel no more than typical levels of disappointment, frustration, pain and social isolation. They express their frustration, disappointment and irritability reasonably and not excessively often. Even when stirred up and upset or angry or irritated, they calm down relatively quickly. They are no more argumentative than average and infrequently lose their composure.
			- If provoked in a dispute, a person of average volatility may react in kind (particularly if also low in agreeableness). However, such people generally remain calm and unperturbed, even when stressed. Volatile people tend to get upset if something bad does happen, while people high in withdrawal (the other aspect of neuroticism) tend to be concerned that something bad might happen. Technically, volatility has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate fight, flight or freeze.
			- Volatility is not strongly related to political preference, either liberal or conservative.
			- Women are higher in volatility than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 57.5. For men it is 42.5.
	- **Openness to Experience: Moderately High**
		- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FTurkhanovKnowledgeBase%2FtTH-EMjoBp.png?alt=media&token=26ccf9d8-78e2-4209-96e6-2202886a30e6)
		- You are moderately high in openness to experience, which is the primary dimension of creativity, artistic interest and intelligence (particularly verbal intelligence) in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Openness to experience is a measure of interest in novelty, art, literature, abstract thinking, philosophy as well as sensitivity to aesthetic emotions and beauty.
		- Your score puts you at the **64th** percentile for openness to experience. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in openness to experience than **64** of them and lower in openness to experience than **35** of them.
		- People with moderately high levels of openness to experience are somewhat more likely than average to be characterized by others as smart, creative, exploratory, intelligent and visionary. They tend to be more interested in learning and in acquiring new abilities and skills. They are curious and exploratory. They find themselves interested in abstract thinking, philosophy, and the meaning of belief systems and ideologies. They attend cultural events such as movies, concerts, dance recitals, plays, poetry readings, gallery openings and art shows. They are likely to enjoy writing. They enjoy complex, abstract ideas more than the average person, and like to confront and solve problems.
		- They are likely to be readers, with a wider range of interests. They have a broader and deeper vocabulary. They can think and learn quite quickly. They are comparatively proficient at formulating new ideas, and tend to be articulate (particularly if average or above in extraversion). People moderately high in openness can sometimes see old things in new ways. They can formulate problems in a diverse range of ways, and can typically generate a reasonable number of problem-solving solutions. They enjoy change, often to make things better, but also just for the sake of change.
		- People who are moderately high in openness to experience are somewhat less well adapted to situations or occupations that are routinized and predictable. They have some trouble fitting in at the bottom of hierarchies. They are less suited to entry-level, repetitive, rote positions, because they often think up new ways to do things, and such ideas are seldom welcome from someone at the bottom. They are creative thinkers. They tend to shake things up a bit, particularly if they are also disagreeable and assertive, and may be attracted to more revolutionary ideas (particularly if below average in conscientiousness).
		- Individuals moderately high in openness to experience tend to be entrepreneurial in spirit, as well as smarter and more creative. They have more than average interest in creating new ventures, sometimes for profit, sometimes for curiosity, and sometimes for personal transformation. At least moderately high levels of openness to experience appear necessary to the formation and leadership of business and other forms of complex organization, although conscientiousness appears required for the attention to detail and process management that such organizations also always need.
		- People moderately high in openness to experience tend to be interested in many things. However, they can still typically settle on a single path in life, to specialize to a necessary degree, and to create an integrated identity (unless they are very high or above in neuroticism and/or very low or below in conscientiousness). People characterized by the combination of moderately high openness to experience and very high or above levels of neuroticism can undermine their own convictions and beliefs by questioning and making themselves lost and anxious. Open, unconscientious people tend to be “under-achievers” (particularly if also above average in neuroticism). Such people appear to have the capability to succeed, can learn quickly, and are creative, but they can have some trouble implementing their ideas.
		- Openness to experience is the dimension that best predicts political allegiance (with conscientiousness, particularly the aspect of orderliness, coming in at second place). Those who are liberal, politically, are very much more likely to be high in openness to experience than conservatives.
		- Women and men differ very little in openness to experience at the trait level, although there are differences in the aspect levels.
		- Trait openness to experience is made up of the aspects of intellect and openness.
		- **Intellect: High**

			- Note: Do not confuse the personality aspect of Intellect with IQ. Intellect is a measure of interest in abstract ideas, essentially, while IQ is a measure of processing speed, verbal ability, working memory, and problem solving capacity, and is better measured with a formal IQ test. It is perfectly possible to have a high IQ and a low score on the personality trait of Intellect (or the reverse).
			- You are high in intellect, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the **78th** percentile for intellect. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in intellect than **78** of them and lower in intellect than **21** of them.
			- People high in intellect are quite interested in ideas and abstract concepts. They enjoy being confronted with novel information, even when it is complex. They are substantially more curious and exploratory than average, and frequently like to tackle and solve problems. They will actively engage in and seek out and initiate issue-oriented discussions, and are likely to read, think about and want to discuss idea-centered books (most frequently non-fiction). They are generally articulate and can formulate ideas clearly and quickly (particularly if average or higher in extraversion). They have a wide vocabulary, and actively enjoy learning new things. People high in intellect will often find and generate novel, creative concepts and voluntarily search for and adapt well to new experience and situations.
			- People high in intellect find complex, rapidly changing occupations to their liking and will generally do well at them (particularly if they are also high in conscientiousness and low in neuroticism). However, they are substantially less well-suited to stable, straightforward and more traditional occupations, where the rules don't change, and will experience frequent periods of boredom and frustration in such positions.
			- Liberals are higher in intellect than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness to experience at the trait level).
			- Women are lower than men in intellect (although not in IQ). This is probably a difference in interest: people high in intellect, compared to openness, are more likely to prefer the sciences to the arts. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 45. For men it is 55.
		- **Openness: Typical or Average**

			- You are average in openness, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the **44th** percentile for openness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in openness than **44** of them and lower in openness than **55** of them.
			- The closest synonym for openness (rather than openness to experience, which encompasses openness and intellect) is creativity. People who are average in openness or creativity find beauty reasonably important. They may enjoy an outlet for their creative ability, but will not wither away without it. They can appreciate art or beautiful crafts. They are somewhat sensitive to color and architectural form. They sometimes enjoy collecting, but it is rare for them to pursue it passionately. They are reasonably imaginative, and may daydream and reflect on occasion. They tend to enjoy music, often of the more conventional popular forms, and may be somewhat musical or artistic themselves (both of these are rare in the general population). They do not generally become so immersed in a book, or a movie, or in their own thoughts, that they lose touch with the outside world. They are interested in but by no means obsessed with beauty, creativity and art.
			- People of typical or average openness tend to be quite stable and reasonably conventional (particularly if they are also average or above in conscientiousness). At least moderate levels of openness tend to be necessary for entrepreneurial success, and prove comparatively useful at the top of hierarchies, even in very conservative occupations such as banking, accounting and law, which need creative people in leadership positions to provide new vision and direction.
			- Liberals are higher in openness than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness to experience, at the trait level).
			- Women are higher in openness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 56.5. For men it is 44.5.
